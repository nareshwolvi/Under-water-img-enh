# Under-water-img-enh
## Abstract

Underwater image enhancement and reconstruction is a challenging task 
and has gained priority in recent years, as the human eye cannot clearly 
perceive underwater images. The image acquisition systems fails to 
capture images with significant detail when used at greater depths 
underwater, such equipment is also expensive. Thus, with the use of image 
processing algorithms it is possible to reconstruct and enhance the image 
quality in the absence of reliable and costly image acquisition systems. We, 
therefore compare four different approaches for the enhancement and 
reconstruction of underwater images. Firstly we use Adaptive Histogram 
Equalization (AHE). Secondly we perform Gamma Correction on the 
image. Brightness preserving Bi-Histogram Equalization (BBHE) is the 
third approach taken. Lastly, we use the Contrast Limited Adaptive 
Histogram equalization (CLAHE).
